How to use wmHexaClock 0.1

GENERAL
-------

wmHexaClock is a DockApp that provides an hexadecimal
clock.


HOW TO USE
----------

It's not too difficult to use wmHexDock. You run it by
typing "wmHexaClock" and confirming with <enter> :)
There are just a few options so far:

	--color (-c)	[COLORCODE]
		You can change to foreground color with this option.
		[COLORCODE] stands for the color which you specifiy in
		hexadecimal notation (RRGGBB). Do not add the #-sign
		in the beginning. Example:
		"wmHexClock -fg-color 00ff00" for green.

	--mode (-m)	[0 or 1] 
		You can run wmHexaClock in two different modes. In
		mode 0 the program will display the time always while
		the name of the day and the date of the day will be displayed
		in turns (Interval is three seconds).
		In mode 1 everything will be displayed the same time. It is much
		more difficult to read it since the space is actually not
		big enough.
	
	--help (-h)
		Might help you

	--version (-v)
		Displays version number

Yes, I didn't write the wohle DockApp from scratch. As a base I took wmDockApp0.1
from Todd Goyen. It is under GPL aswell and you will find it
here: http://dockapps.org/download.php/id/138/wmDockApp.tar.gz

Thanks a lot!
