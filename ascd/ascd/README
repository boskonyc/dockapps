DESCRIPTION:

AScd is a CD player that can be "docked" on the Afterstep Wharf or the
Window Maker dock. It uses libworkman to access CD drivers.

========================================================================

HISTORY:

AScd 0.1 -> 0.6
---------------

The original code was taken by Rob Malda from asclock (Afterstep wharf
module, by Beat Christen <bchriste@iiic.ethz.ch>) and from workbone (CD
driver). 

AScd 0.7 -> 0.9
---------------

I removed all the workbone code (Linux specific): ascd could then be compiled
on several UN*X flavors. I took a big part or the WorkMan (see at the end of
this text) src and merged it with the ascd 0.4 interface. The WorkMan code
was compiled as a library.

AScd >= 0.10
------------

WorkMan has splitted in 2 parts: the ui and the lib, named libworkman. So,
AScd uses this brand new lib, instead of the one which was included in the
AScd's archive. WorkMan's maintainer is Dirk Foersterling
(milliByte@DeathsDoor.com).

AScd >= 0.12
------------

AScd no longer includes the pixmaps in the source files. It is now possible 
to change the pixmaps theme at run time. AScd now needs a directory where
to store the pixmaps. The default is /usr/local/share/AScd.

AScd >= 0.13
------------

The theme files are now fully customizable. All theme directories are
installed by default in /usr/local/share/AScd/Themes.

========================================================================
                             HOW TO COMPILE????
========================================================================

You need to download, compile and install the WorkMan library. Please
use the 99/05/05 snapshot wish can be found on the AScd's home page or
on the primary ftp site for WorkMan: 

ftp://ftp.midwinter.com/WorkMan/snapshots/

========================================================================
                              CONFIGURATION
========================================================================

Run ./configure

This script will ask you a few questions about compilation-time
options, and generate a "config.h" file matching your choices. The
script will then run xmkmf to generate the Makefile.

========================================================================
                          COMPILATION/INSTALLATION
========================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you're upgrading from AScd 0.12, please remove
everything in the AScd default directory (/usr/local/share/AScd) as the
theme files are *not* compatible.

    make
  
  - If you want to try the program, just type
    
    ./ascd
    
    (try './ascd -help' to see the commandline options)

    If everything is ok, you can install the program and the
    man page:
    
    make install
    make install.man


* installation for AfterStep
  --------------------------

  Add a line in your ~/.steprc file:

  *Wharf - - Swallow "ascd" /usr/local/bin/ascd -device /dev/wcd0a &

  (customized to your system settings of course!)
  
* installation for Window Maker
  -----------------------------

  Launch ascd with the "+w" option.
  Dock ascd by dragging it to the dock.

  The 0.12 *digits.xpm were taken and modified from wmitime, an excellent
  clock applet for Window Maker. Wmitime was written by Dave Clark
  (clarkd@skynet.ca) More info at: http://www.neotokyo.org. I added the
  lower case letters.
  
  The new 0.13 default font is fully 8bit compatible! It has been drawn
  by Stefan Zeiger (szeiger@novocode.com).
