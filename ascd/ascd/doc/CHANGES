  several smaller C files.
- [bug] the WINGs support shall *not* compile. I didn't have time

- the database edition fixed (didn't save!!!)

=====================================================================

* Lib:

- [BIG FIX] ascd now ejects CDs under FreeBSD. And there should be
  no more device locking (it was necessary to quit ascd to eject
  the CD and/or to mount a cdrom). Think this works with NetBSD too.
  (bug found in 0.4+, 0.6+, 0.7 & 0.8)

  of OSS.

  player and the mixer.
- all the mixer settings can be saved in a ~/.ascdrc file. This file
  can be loaded at startup.

  new commands. See ascd -help for further details.

* Lib:

- [fix] I forgot to add the plat_openbsd.c in the Imakefile!

  shared lib. Tested with FreeBSD 2.2.

* Ascd:

- Almost total rewrite of cd_control() function. The code should be
  more reliable (I hope!). Some clean-ups two.
- no more uses old ascd variables (currenttrack, maxtracks, playing, 
  paused). Only the WorkMan ones (cur_track, cur_ntracks, cur_cdmode)
  are used.
- on launch, if autoplay is disabled, the track nbr panel displays
  how tracks are on the CD instead of "01".
- when the time panel displays the global remaining time of the CD, 
  the track nbr panel displays the number of remaining tracks.

- adjusted timing for checking inserted CD in autoplay mode.
- Middle click on the display switch the mute mode. Muted/Unmuted 
  volumes can be set with 'm' and 'v' command line parameters.

  drive didn't play this one automatically.

  changes.

- added a "mixer screen" based on asmixer 0.5: clic on 
  time display with right button to switch to it.

  mixer screen (same as asmixer). Removed the old -v option.

- added the new options (since 0.7) in the man page 

=====================================================================

09/04/97: 0.7 release

(denis) based on 0.4+, but with the WindowMaker specific code taken
from ascd 0.6

- added: "-v" command line option to specify the volume to set
  when right-clicking on the time display.

  and a "o" if it displays the CD ellapsed/remaining time.
- added: folding tags in the ascd.c for the jed editor

- added: clicking on the "DOWN" button restart the track ; another
  click plays the previous track, like on a diskman (from Rob's
  ascd 0.6)
- fixed: redisplay of the XPMs was buggy with 0.4+ (but worked with
  afterstep... this fix is primary for WM)
- fixed: when autoplay is off, ascd doesn't scan the CD drive until
  you click on a button. No more thousands of "cannot read audio disk"
  in the FreeBSD logs :) (but there's still the problem with the "-a"
  option)

=====================================================================

v0.6
- Most important: WindowMaker Dock support with the -w flag!
   
=====================================================================

03/25/97: 0.4+ release

(denis) this is a bug-fixes release.

- fix: when first launch and if there was no CD in drive, a click on
  the play button crashed the program.
- fixed a "floating point exception" when the track progress bar is
  clicked on the very top.
- changed the "0.4" to "0.4+" for the "-h" option.

=====================================================================

03/23-24/97: 0.4+ release

(denis) Based on Rob Malda's ascd 0.4. All the Workbone Code has been
removed. I use the Workman source code: ascd can be compiled on
several systems with several kinds of CD players, but tests have been
made only on FreeBSD 2.2.X (i386) and Linux 2.X (i386) with IDE
drives. Should work with SCSI drives too. (note: I removed the Workman
database code)

- Imakefile has been updated for the Workman code.
- added: several new features (loops, introscan, progress bar...)
  (see the README file)
- changed the XPM files for the new buttons and the progress bar.
- added: 4th digit for songs longer than 10 minutes.
- added: -a command line option. Activates the autoplay mode: ascd
  automatically plays the CD when it is inserted.
- added: -c command line option which sets the value, in seconds, 
  for the intro scan mode and the cue/review function.
- changed the indentation in the source code with the auto-
  indentation in jed. Sorry ;-)
- when a DATA CDROM is inserted, the display now show "--:--".
- a few fixes in ascd.c
- the default device is now /dev/cdrom.

=====================================================================

v0.4 - 1.15.96
- Thanks olly again (Does this guy sleep?) We have a few
  very nice bug fixes, and a nice new feature.
- ascd now stops correctly at the end of a CD.
- 'Next Track' used to go to far
- When ascd is paused, the LED now blinks!
- v0.4's secret code word is LLAMA BAIT

=====================================================================

v0.3 - 1.13.96
- Thanks to olly@muscat.co.uk, if a CD is playing when
  ascd launches, it detects this and starts following it.
- Thanks to the 9,000 of you who e-mailed me fixes (thanks
  guys, its nice to know people use this crap!) a Data CD
  will not crash ascd.
- About 15 people sent in CHEEZ DOODLE's to me.  Thanks.
  The code word for v0.3 is ORANGE NIPPLE.

=====================================================================

v0.2
- Fixed Certain Neat Error Messages
- I Think it should now get the last track from CD's.
- It shouldn't *lock* the CD Player from other devices
  once you press the 'stop' button.  This is especially
  useful with ascdc.
- Now includes the correct README file.  Thanks to the
  Hundreds of you who caught that.  It's nice to know
  someone reads these files.
