TODO list for wmTicTacToe
--------------------------------------------------------------

...this is a list of things I've already planned for next version(or nexteds):

	- create a super hiper nice very good X play algorithm;
	- Alfredo Kojima(Window Maker's creator) suggested deadmatch games 
          over internet; If you're interessing, go ahead! ;)
	- something more?

Your feedback! If you have nice suggestions, ideas, whatever,
that aren't on this list, feel free to mail them to:

	acamargo@conesul.com.br

If you don't let me know... how am I suppose to know? ;-)
