Description
-----------------------------------=======================================

	wmTicTacToe, as you can imagine, is a dock application game for
Window Maker(but it will be run on others window managers too.  You can
test it... and after, give me your feedback...) 

	wmTicTacToe is being developped on Pentium 133 machine running
Linux/Conectiva Guarani, and I can't test on other machines 'cos I don't
know people that have one... If YOU test it, give me your feedback,
please...


Why write a game so... useless!? :P
===================================----------------------------------------

	Well, it's a short history... :)
	I wanna programming for linux, but I didn't know how... Then, I
have a class called "Prática de Programação", where, pupil have that
create a software(any kind of software), immediatelly I thought: - WhY nOt
cReaTE a SmaLL gAme fOr mY faVoriTe wInDoW mAnAgeR!? Five days after, here
it is... version 0.1, of course... :)

	ps.: I take 10 points... great :)


How do I play wmTicTacToe?
-----------------------------------========================================

	It's very simple!
	You can play versus XFree(computer) or versus GNUstep(a friend, etc).
	To active _deadmatch_ game mode, it run wmtictactoe with option:
	-deadmatch
	Click with right button change between scoreboard and gameboard.
        In scoreboard, click with middle button reset the score, with
right button go to gameboard screen and click with left button change the 
game mode.
        In gameboard, click with left button to play, right button go to 
scoreboard screen and middle button to reset the game...
        ... and, don't forget, the game has Offensive and Defensive mode!
	
Deadmatch!
