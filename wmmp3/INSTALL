wmmp3 v0.06 INSTALL -- Patrick Crosby <xb@dotfiles.com>

1. Type './configure'

2. Type 'make'

3. Type 'make install'

The default will probably put it in /usr/local/bin.  Use 

	./configure --help 

to set various options if the default is not right for you.

4. Copy the sample .wmmp3 file to your home directory:

	cp sample.wmmp3 ~/.wmmp3

5. Edit ~/.wmmp3 to set the directories where your mp3 files live.

6. The executable is 'wmmp3', so run it.
