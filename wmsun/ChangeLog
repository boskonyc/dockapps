	you can have the display be correct in local time even for remote
        lat/lons. (I am in Hawaii right now. I dont want to reset the time on
        my laptop, so with these new options I can still get the correct
        local times of rise/set. Sunset is awesome here in Kona!!! And the calcs
        seem to be quite good -- it's a good test here because the Sun sets over
        the Pacific (no mountains are in the way)).
