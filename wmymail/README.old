name            : wmail (Window Maker DockApp email flag)
current version : 1.1
last update     : Oct 13 2000

description     :

 This is wmail - a little dockable application watching your email-file
 and signaling changes. It works quite similar to xbiff
 but provides a more informative, more interactive and yes, more colorful nice
 little gui displaying some useful pieces of state-informations about that
 file.
 It uses the $MAIL environment-variable to locate the email-file you are using,
 other mailing mechanisms like POP or IMAP are currently not supported.

 It shows the following:

 - a mail-icon in the upper-left if the file contains some mails
 - a frequently blinking mail-text in the upper-right if there are unread mails
 - a ticker displaying eighter the complete mail-adress, it's name-part or the
   full sender name
 - the number of emails stored in the file

 In addition, the button labeled `Client' allowes you to quickly run your
 preferred email-client.

 Last, there are some attributes you can customize via the command-line.
 So it's possible to set the interval-time between the updates, the
 shell-command to run the client, what the ticker has to show and what colors
 should be used. Custom coloring is what every dockapp should support, but
 unfortunatly most didn't came with this nice and useful feature :(

 Bugs: be sure there are! Since many time and motivation is needed to clean
 even such a little app properly there are good chances this friendly toy
 will change into an aggressive animal ready to cause irreversible damage -
 thus, keep in mind this code comes with absolutly no warran...blablabla
