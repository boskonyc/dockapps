    readme for wmymail - mail checker dock application

wmymail is a dock application that shows how many messages are in your
mailbox, and how many of them are unread.  When there are new messages,
it displays one or more brightly colored envelopes.  Otherwise, it
displays a dull, gray envelope.


BEHAVIOR
========

mbox (local mail file) (default)
--------------------------------

By default, it will check your mailbox file about once per second to
see if it has changed. If it has changed, wmymail reads it to see how
many messages are inside, and how many have been read, and displays
the current counts.

  * It looks at the filename specified in the $MAIL environment
    variable.

  * You can tell it to look in a different file by using the -m
    option, e.g.  "wmymail -m /var/foo/mail/username"

  * You can make it check less frequently with the -i option, which
    changes the interval between mailbox checks:
    "wmymail -i 60" will make it check once per minute.

IMAP
----

If you are using IMAP for your email, you will need to use the -F
option. This option makes wmymail run fetchmail to determine how
many messages you have.

Since running fetchmail takes considerably longer than checking
a local file, wmymail checks once per minute when -F is used.
Furthermore, the -i option now specifies the number of minutes:
"wmymail -F -i 5" would make it check every five minutes.

The command that wmymail runs is: "fetchmail -c"
Therefore, you will need to have fetchmail set up and working prior
to using wmymail.


HISTORY
=======

The current maintainer is Joshua Swink, <yathster@yahoo.com>.

This program forked from version 1.1 of wmail, a similar dock app with
different goals.

wmail may be found here:

And here is its old homepage (no longer exists):

INSTALLATION
============

You will need libdockapp, which can probably be found here:

  ftp://shadowmere.student.utwente.nl/pub/WindowMaker/

Then, run "make", and "strip wmymail" if desired, and finally
copy wmymail to a directory in your path.

Making it show up on your dock or wharf or pier varies greatly
according to your window manager, and won't be explained here.
