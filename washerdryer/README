washerDryer-1.1  Public Release
Mike Foley (foley@ucsd.edu)

washerDryer keeps track of the loads in your washer and
dryer, and alerts you when they are ready.

I'm bad at remembering when to take my clothes out, so I wrote
this program to help me. Hopefully other people will find it
useful as well.

Some features are:

    * Keeps track of up to 10 loads at once
    * Alerts you with system beep, or any command you specify
    * Fully compatible with WindowMaker as a dockapp
    * Command line options (-h for help)
    * Customize the program through config file, command line
      options, or on the fly

Credits
--------------------------------------------------------------
This application started out as a heavily modified version of
WMTimer 2.2, written by Josh King. The source code provided
the framework for my program, and it was an invaluable
resource.

I used methods from the wmgeneral libraries, written by
Martijn Pieterse. The wmgeneral libraries make it much easier
to write dockapps.

I used the config file reading methods from WMiNET 2.0.3,
written by Dave Clark, Antoine Nulle, and Martijn Pieterse.
I also used some of its documentation as a framework for mine.


Bugs & Feedback
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you discover any bugs in this software, or have any
suggestions about the program, please send a report to
the author.

I appreciate user feedback. If you find this program useful,
send me an email. I would be glad to know if I helped people
out there who are as disorganized as I am!
